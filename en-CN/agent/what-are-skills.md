# What Are Skills

<Frames

  alt="What is a Skill"

Skills are reusable knowledge packages that extend what an Agent can do. Each Skill contains:

- **Approaches and operating instructions** — Methods tailored to specific task types
- **Best practices and conventions** — Industry standards and internal guidelines to follow
- **Optional scripts, tools, and reference resources** — Practical utilities and materials that support execution

## How to Use Skills

From discovering Skills to creating your own, the full workflow is:

1. **Discover Skills** — Browse official and recommended Skills in the Skills panel to find one that fits your scenario.
2. **Install a Skill** — Click ➕ to add it in one step.
3. **Invoke a Skill** — Type `/` in the chat input box and select Skills, or let Kimi Agent trigger the right Skill automatically based on your question.
4. **Create your own Skill** — If existing Skills do not meet your needs, upload a document or describe what you want in a conversation to generate a dedicated Skill. You can also create a custom Skill through a `/skill-creator` conversation.

## How Do Skills Work?

At its core, a Skill is a folder with a fixed structure. It clearly describes the standard operating procedure (SOP), methodology, and reference templates needed to complete a task.

To keep conversations efficient, the Agent does not load the entire Skill all at once. Instead, it uses a “progressive disclosure” mechanism: during the conversation, it determines which Skills are relevant to the current task and loads only the information needed to complete it, avoiding context window overload.

**Basic SKILL.md template:**

<CodePreview
  files={[
    {
      name: "SKILL.md",
      language: "markdown",
      content: "---\nname: your-skill-name\ndescription: What it does and when Kimi should use it\n---\n\n# Skill Title\n\n## Instructions\nClear, concrete, actionable rules.\n\n## Examples\n- Example usage 1\n- Example usage 2\n\n## Guidelines\n- Guideline 1\n- Guideline 2",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Skills vs. Asking Directly

Take writing a weekly report as an example. If you ask Kimi Agent directly, it will write in the format it understands. After you install a weekly report Skill, it will output the report every time using the structure, tone, and length you set, without needing repeated instructions.

| | Asking directly | Using Skills |
|---|---|---|
| Need to explain requirements each time | Yes | No, applied automatically |
| Consistent output format | Not guaranteed | Consistent with the Skill definition |
| Best for | One-off or temporary tasks | Fixed workflows performed repeatedly |
| Setup required in advance | No | Yes, create or install a Skill |
