# About Kimi Claw Android

Kimi Claw Android is an app that deploys OpenClaw on an Android phone. Unlike cloud-based Kimi Claw, OpenClaw in Kimi Claw Android does not run on a cloud virtual machine. It runs on your own phone as a dedicated machine inside your terminal.

#### Backup and restore

Kimi Claw Android provides automatic and manual backup features to ensure your OpenClaw history and configurations are not lost.

**Automatic backup**

After each successful OpenClaw Gateway startup, Kimi Claw Android automatically backs up the current OpenClaw history and configurations, packages them as a compressed file, and saves it. No manual action is required; the system completes this automatically in the background.

**Manual backup**

If you want to save the state at a specific moment, you can also tap Backup to manually save a snapshot of the current history and configurations. Tap Backup to export all current configuration backups.

  width={1080}
  height={2392}
/>


**Restore configurations**

Kimi Claw Android supports restoring to a previous configuration state. Both automatic backup states and manually backed-up states from Kimi Claw Android are supported.

You can use restore to return to an earlier state in the following scenarios:

- If history is lost after uninstalling or reinstalling the App, you can restore previous records
- If you need to switch Claw configurations, you can restore to a previously saved configuration state
- When deploying again on a new phone, import the backup file to restore

Tap the corresponding backup file in the backup list to automatically restore the history and configurations from that point in time, ensuring previous records are not erased.

## Automation

One of Kimi Claw Android’s core capabilities is controlling apps on the phone to complete various tasks. After you send instructions to Claw through chat channels such as Kimi, Feishu, or WeChat, Claw will automatically open the corresponding App on the phone and perform a series of actions like a real user, ultimately completing the task you specify.

### How it works

When you send a task instruction to Claw through a chat channel, Claw will:

1. Understand your task requirements
2. Automatically open the corresponding App on the phone
3. Complete the task step by step by simulating user actions, such as tapping, swiping, and typing
4. Take screenshots during execution so you can review the process
5. Report the execution result to you after completing the task

<Callout type="warning">
Automation runs relatively slowly. We recommend using an idle phone.
</Callout>

### Common use cases

#### Shopping and consumption

Search for products, add items to cart, check orders, claim coupons, and more on platforms such as Taobao, Tmall, and Meituan.

#### Travel and navigation

Check ride-hailing prices on Amap, view metro timetables, search for nearby hotels, book trips, and more.

#### Social and content

View messages, browse content, search for products, and interact on platforms such as Xiaohongshu and Douyin.

## Tips

### Control your phone through chat apps

After setup is complete, you can send instructions to Claw in Kimi, Feishu, or WeChat to remotely control apps on your Android phone. For example:

- "Open WeChat for me and check the latest messages"
- "Open the map and search for restaurants nearby"
- "Check my calendar and see what I have scheduled today"

### Use SkillHub Skills

Kimi Claw Android includes the SkillHub skill library. You can manage and install skills in Settings to extend Claw with more capabilities.

**Scenarios suitable for using Skills:**

- **Information organization**: News summaries, competitor comparisons
- **Data analysis**: Market review, data interpretation
- **Workflow automation**: End-to-end processes from requirement breakdown to final output

### Stay online across multiple channels

You can connect multiple channels such as Kimi, Feishu, and WeChat at the same time, so you can chat with Claw in different chat apps. In Dashboard channel management, tap “+ Connect” to add one.

## Safety and restricted apps

### Safety notes

Before using Kimi Claw Android, please note the following safety points:

1. **Use an idle phone** — Kimi Claw Android uses phone operation permissions and may affect daily use. An idle phone is recommended
2. **Isolate sensitive data** — Kimi Claw Android reads local file data. Please clean up or isolate sensitive information in advance
3. **Protect financial apps** — The system automatically blocks access to banking, payment, securities, and insurance apps to protect your funds. We also strongly recommend that you do not install banking, payment, securities, insurance, or other financial apps on the current phone
