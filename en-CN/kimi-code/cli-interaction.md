# Interaction and Input

Kimi Code CLI provides several ways to interact with AI, helping you collaborate more efficiently.

## Thinking mode

Thinking mode lets AI reason more deeply before responding, making it suitable for complex tasks.

- Use the `/model` command to switch models and Thinking mode.
- You can also enable Thinking mode at startup with the `--thinking` parameter.

## Multiline input

Press **Ctrl-J** to insert a line break for multiline input. This is useful for longer prompts or pasting multi-line code snippets.

## Clipboard paste

Press **Ctrl-V** to paste content from the clipboard. Text and images are supported. When you paste an image, AI can directly understand its content, such as screenshots, design drafts, and error screenshots.

## Slash commands

Commands starting with `/` are used to manage sessions, configuration, and debugging. Common commands include:

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/help` | Show help information |
| `/login` | Log in and authorize |
| `/model` | Switch models and Thinking mode |
| `/sessions` | List and switch sessions |
| `/clear` | Clear the current context |
| `/compact` | Compact the context |
| `/init` | Generate AGENTS.md |
| `/exit` | Exit the CLI |

After you type `/` in the input box, the list of available commands appears automatically.

## @ path completion

Use the `@` symbol in your input to reference a file or directory path. The system will complete the path automatically:

<CodePreview
  files={[
    {
      name: "prompt.txt",
      language: "text",
      content: "Please check whether @src/utils/auth.ts has any security risks",
    },
  ]}
/>

AI will then automatically read the referenced file content as context.

## Structured Q&A

In some scenarios, AI may ask for your input in the form of structured options. Use the **arrow keys** to select an option, then press **Enter** to confirm.

## Approval prompts

When AI needs to modify files, run Shell commands, or perform similar actions, it will ask for your confirmation. You can choose:

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Allow** | Allow this operation |
| **Allow for this session** | Allow similar operations during the current session without asking again |
| **Deny** | Deny this operation |

### YOLO mode

If you trust the AI’s actions, you can use YOLO mode to skip all confirmations:

<CodePreview
  files={[
    {
      name: "command.sh",
      language: "bash",
      content: "kimi --yolo",
    },
  ]}
/>

<Callout type="warning">
In YOLO mode, AI will automatically perform all operations. Use it with caution. We recommend using it only in a controlled development environment.
</Callout>
