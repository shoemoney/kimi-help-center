# FAQ

## Guide to migrating from legacy Kimi-Cli to the new version

<Callout type="info">
Kimi Code CLI has received a major version upgrade. Its underlying runtime has moved from Python/uv to Node.js, bringing simpler installation, faster startup, and a redesigned terminal interface. The legacy version will gradually stop being maintained, so we recommend upgrading to the new version as soon as possible.
</Callout>

If you are migrating from the legacy version, follow the steps below. A single command can migrate your configuration, MCP server settings, and session history to the new version.

### What’s better in the new version

- **No Python / uv dependency**: Rewritten on Node.js, with no Python environment setup required and simpler installation
- **Native binary, ready to use**: Faster startup and a lighter runtime
- **Fully redesigned terminal interface**: Smoother interactions
- **Complete data migration**: Configuration, MCP settings, and session history can all be moved over in one step for a seamless transition

### How to migrate

There are two ways to migrate.

After installing kimi-code, the **first time you run `kimi`**, it will automatically check whether kimi-cli data exists under `~/.kimi/`. If data is found, you’ll see a migration prompt and can choose to migrate now, remind me later, or don’t show again.

You can also **run the migration manually at any time**:

<CodePreview
  files={[
    {
      name: "command.sh",
      language: "bash",
      content: "kimi migrate",
    },
  ]}
/>

You can choose whether to migrate chat sessions as well. If you do not need your history for now, choose **Config only**; otherwise, choose **Config + N sessions** to migrate them together. A results summary will be shown when the migration finishes.

### What happens during migration

**What will be migrated**: configuration (`config.toml`), MCP service configuration, input history, and the chat sessions you choose to migrate.

**What will not be migrated**: OAuth login credentials and MCP service authorizations will not be copied. After migration, you need to run `/login` again in kimi-code and reauthorize MCP services. kimi-cli plugins are also outside the migration scope.

<Callout type="tip">
Migration **will not modify or delete** any legacy data under `~/.kimi/`. kimi-cli can still be used as usual, and the two versions do not affect each other. Migration can also be run repeatedly; sessions that have already been migrated will not be imported again.
</Callout>

After migration, sessions imported from kimi-cli will be marked with `[imported]`, making them easy to distinguish from newly created sessions.

## Installation and authentication

### Empty model list during `/login`

If you see the error "No models available for the selected platform" when running the `/login` command, it may be due to one of the following reasons:

- **Invalid or expired API key**: Check whether the API key you entered is correct and still valid.
- **Network connection issue**: Confirm that you can access the API service address normally, such as `api.kimi.com` or `api.moonshot.cn`.

**Check the platform carefully**

 Kimi Code membership benefits and the [Kimi Open Platform](https://platform.kimi.com) use different Base URLs. When configuring, make sure the Base URL matches the API Key.

| Platform | Base URL | Billing | Key creation entry |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Kimi Code** | Anthropic-compatible: `https://api.kimi.com/coding/` | Kimi membership subscription (including credits) | [Kimi Code Console](https://www.kimi.com/code/console) |
| **Kimi Open Platform** | `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1` | Pay-as-you-go | [Kimi Open Platform official site](https://platform.kimi.com) |


### Invalid API key

An API key may be invalid for the following reasons:

- **Incorrect key entered**: Check for extra spaces or missing characters.
- **Key expired or revoked**: Confirm the key status in the platform console.

### Membership expired or quota used up

If you use the Kimi Code platform, you can run the `/usage` command to view your current quota and membership status. If your quota has been used up or your membership has expired, renew or upgrade at [Kimi Code](https://kimi.com/code).

## Subscription

### How to request an invoice or upgrade membership

Go to the [Kimi membership benefits page](https://www.kimi.com/membership/pricing#pricing-faq) and follow the on-page instructions to request an invoice or upgrade your membership.

## Interaction issues

### Failed to paste an image

When pasting an image with `Ctrl-V`, if you see "Current model does not support image input", it means the current model does not support image input.

How to fix it:

- **Switch to a model that supports images**: Use a model with the `image_in` capability.
- **Check the clipboard content**: Make sure the clipboard actually contains image data, not the path to an image file.

## Updates and upgrades

### Slow first launch on macOS

macOS Gatekeeper checks new programs the first time they are run, which may slow down startup. To resolve this:

- **Wait for the check to finish**: Please wait patiently during the first launch. Subsequent launches will return to normal.
- **Add it to Developer Tools**: Add your terminal app under “System Settings → Privacy & Security → Developer Tools”.

### How to upgrade Kimi Code CLI

Run `kimi upgrade` in the CLI. It will automatically check for the latest version and guide you through the upgrade. You can also use a package manager directly:

```sh
npm install -g @moonshot-ai/kimi-code@latest
```

## VS Code extension FAQ

Below are common questions about the Kimi Code VS Code extension (VS Code Extension).

### VS Code says no workspace is open

Open a folder in VS Code. The Kimi Code VS Code extension requires a workspace to work properly.

### VS Code says the CLI cannot be found

Install Kimi Code CLI manually and configure `kimi.executablePath` in VS Code settings, or make sure the built-in CLI exists.

### VS Code login failed

Try skipping login and using API key mode, check your network connection, or try again later from the VS Code extension action menu.

### No response after sending a message in VS Code

Confirm that Kimi Code CLI is available, the model is configured, and a workspace folder is open in VS Code. Use "Kimi Code: Show Logs" to view error logs.

### VS Code connection timeout

If there is no response within 30 seconds, the connection will time out. Check your network and try again.

### VS Code reports an error before sending a message

Some errors may prevent messages from being sent in VS Code, such as Kimi Code CLI not found, an outdated version, not logged in, or a busy session. The error will be shown as a toast, and your input will be kept so you can retry.
