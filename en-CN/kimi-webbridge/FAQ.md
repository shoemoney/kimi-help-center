# FAQ

## Product version

### What's the relationship between Kimi WebBridge and Kimi Browser Extension?

Kimi WebBridge has been renamed to Kimi Browser Extension, with new features including a browser sidebar entry, web action recording, and breaking down web pages into instructions. The way local Agents call the extension remains unchanged and can continue to be used; the new sidebar entry requires signing in with a Kimi membership account.

## Installation and Setup

### When installing the extension, it says "Cannot add app from this website"?

Please make sure you install it from an official app store (Chrome Web Store or Edge Add-ons). If you cannot access the app store, use the manual installation method provided on the official website.

### Nothing happens after running the connection command?

Check whether your network connection is working properly. If the issue persists, restart Kimi Claw Desktop and run the command again.

### Can I use it on multiple computers?

Yes. Kimi Browser Extension needs to be installed and configured separately on each computer.

### Can’t find Kimi Claw Desktop?

Kimi Claw Desktop is Kimi Claw deployed on your local computer. Open Kimi Desktop, find Kimi Claw in the left sidebar, create a new Claw, and choose to deploy it to "My Computer".

## Connection and Usage

### The extension status shows not connected?

Please confirm that the Kimi Browser Extension has been installed successfully, then follow the steps for your setup:

- **Kimi Desktop**: Restart Kimi Desktop and try again
- **Other Local Agents**: Send the following command again in your Agent, then restart the Agent after running it:

<CodePreview
  files={[
    {
      name: "command.sh",
      language: "bash",
      content: "curl -fsSL https://kimi-web-img.moonshot.cn/webbridge/install_skill.sh | bash -s -- -y",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Installing Kimi Browser Extension on Windows reports: installation failed
Kimi Browser Extension supports Windows. You can run the installation command in a Linux environment:

<CodePreview
  files={[
    {
      name: "command.sh",
      language: "bash",
      content: "irm https://kimi-web-img.moonshot.cn/webbridge/install.ps1 | iex",
    },
  ]}
/>

### I’ve completed the installation steps, but it says it’s incompatible with Chrome when I use it. What’s going on?

If Kimi Browser Extension can open web pages normally, but operations such as `snapshot`, `evaluate`, `screenshot`, and `click` keep failing, the more common cause is **a conflict with other browser extensions**.

Crawler, website assistant, screen recording, and AI assistant extensions are especially likely to affect Kimi Browser Extension.

Try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Open your browser’s extensions management page
2. Temporarily disable other extensions
3. Keep only Kimi Browser Extension enabled
4. Restart the browser and try again
5. If everything works again, re-enable the other extensions one by one to identify the conflicting extension

### Will Kimi Browser Extension leak my login information?

No. Everything runs locally on your device. Your login state and web page content do not leave your device. The Agent can only access the operation results you authorize.

### Why do operations sometimes fail?

Complex page structures or dynamic loading may cause operations to fail. Try simplifying your instructions, or ask the Agent to take a screenshot first to confirm the page state before performing the operation.

### Which browsers are supported?

Chrome and Edge are currently supported. We recommend using the latest version for the best experience.

## Working with Other Agents

### Besides Kimi, which Agents are supported?

Kimi Browser Extension supports all Local Agents, including Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Kimi Code, Hermes Claw, and more.

### Is the setup the same for different Agents?

The configuration command is the same: run a single curl command to complete the installation. For details, refer to the Skill configuration method for each Agent.
