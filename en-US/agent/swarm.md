# K2.6 Agent Swarm [Beta]

<Callout type="info">
**K2.6 Agent Swarm [Beta]** is a "horizontal scaling" architecture that coordinates up to 300 sub-agents working in parallel — no predefined roles or hand-crafted workflows required. It completes tasks approximately **4.5× faster** than single-agent execution.
</Callout>

On January 27, 2026, Moonshot AI released Kimi K2.5, introducing Agent Swarm [Beta]. On April 20, 2026, Moonshot AI released and open-sourced Kimi K2.6, bringing major upgrades to the Agent Swarm architecture:
- Up to **300 sub-agents** working simultaneously
- Over **4,000 tool calls** per task
- **4.5× faster** than single-agent sequential execution

## The story behind

In 2025, the AI industry's dominant narrative focused on vertical scaling — bigger models, more parameters. But this hits a structural ceiling: the single sequential execution bottleneck.

Agent Swarm was born from a real scenario: when a team member tried to automate daily stock information collection and hit 100 lines of if-else code, she realized: "I'm hand-writing a multi-agent system." If models can use tools, why can't they self-architect?

Agent Swarm is a self-designed organizational structure — designed by AI, not humans. The main Agent (orchestrator) autonomously directs up to 300 sub-agents, executing up to 4,000 parallel workflow steps.

K2.6 Agent Swarm [Beta] uses the PARL (Parallel-Agent Reinforcement Learning) training method. Compared to single-agent approaches, it reduces critical steps by 3×–4.5× in large-scale search scenarios.

**Access Points:**
- **Web**: [kimi.com/agent-swarm](https://www.kimi.com/agent-swarm)
- **Mobile**: Kimi app → Switch mode → Select K2.6 Agent Swarm [Beta]

<Callout type="warning">
**Beta Access**: K2.6 Agent Swarm [Beta] is currently available to Moderato, Allegretto, Allegro, and Vivace members. Tasks consume significantly more quota than standard Agent tasks.
</Callout>

**Steps:**
1. Describe your task and send it (e.g., "Collect 200+ Paul Graham articles")
2. Watch real-time progress: task list creation, sub-agent spawning, parallel execution
3. Receive deliverables: code projects, file folders, data analysis, Office documents
4. Preview, download, or share results
5. Switch to single K2.6 Agent to continue in subsequent turns

## Use cases

### Discovery at scale

**Case 1: Top 3 Creators Across 100 YouTube Niches**

## Technical deep dive

**Core Architecture: Commander + Specialists**

- **Orchestrator** = Coach/Commander: Sees the big picture, sets strategy
- **Sub-agents** = Players: Each focused on a specific role

**Key Design: Freeze the Players, Train Only the Coach**

All sub-agents retain existing capabilities; only the orchestrator improves through reinforcement learning. This provides clear accountability and training stability.

**Preventing "Laziness":**
- **Serial collapse**: Orchestrator handing everything to one sub-agent
- **Fake parallelism**: Meaningless sub-tasks to game metrics

**Solution: Three-Dimensional Reward Mechanism**
1. Quality of final result
2. True parallelism achieved
3. Sub-task completion rate

**Critical Steps Metric**

Agent Swarm calculates the slowest sub-agent's time at each stage. This forces genuine process optimization rather than blind task splitting.

**Context Sharding**

Each sub-agent focuses on its own "notebook," recording relevant details independently. Only key conclusions are reported to the orchestrator — preserving reasoning without overwhelming memory.

**Real-World Results**

On the BrowseComp benchmark:
- Accuracy: 15.9% (single agent) → 33.3%
- Critical steps reduced by ~40%

## Application scenarios

K2.6 Agent Swarm [Beta] is especially suited for:
1. **Large-scale information retrieval**: Massive internet data collection
2. **Batch downloads**: Large-scale file and resource collection
3. **Wide-scope reading**: Processing 100+ documents
