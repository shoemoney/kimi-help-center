# Core concepts & terminal

## Key concepts

| Concept | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Memory** | Kimi Claw's long-term memory system. Stores your preferences, habits, and important information across conversations. |
| **Skills** | Installable capability modules from the ClawHub library that give Kimi Claw domain-specific expertise. |
| **HEARTBEAT** | Scheduled background tasks that run on a timer — useful for recurring reminders, data pulls, and digests. |
| **Identity** | Kimi Claw's role definition: name, profession, persona. Fully customizable by you. |
| **Soul** | Core personality traits and behavioral principles that shape Kimi Claw's interaction style. |
| **Tools** | The set of capabilities Kimi Claw can invoke — web search, file handling, code execution, and more. |
| **User** | The relationship definition between you and Kimi Claw, which governs interaction patterns and information sharing. |

## Terminal

You can open a command-line interface via **Settings → Terminal** on the web, and run commands to control Kimi Claw directly.

Alternatively, just tell Kimi Claw what command to run in plain language — it will execute it for you.

> Note: The Terminal and plugins share the same connection channel. Restarting the OpenClaw gateway will disconnect the Terminal.
