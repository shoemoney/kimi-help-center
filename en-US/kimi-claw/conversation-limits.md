# Conversation limits

When the conversation context grows too long and exceeds the model's token limit, Kimi Claw may stop responding or return an error.

**How to fix it:**

- Send `/new` to start a fresh conversation and clear the current context.
- If the error persists after `/new`, too many Skills may be loaded into memory. Try:
  - `/skills` — review installed skills and uninstall any you don't need.
  - `/compact` — compress the current context to reclaim space.
  - `/reset` — fully reset Kimi Claw as a last resort.
