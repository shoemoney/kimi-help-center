# Kimi Websites

<Callout type="info">
**Kimi Websites** is a Kimi Agent product feature powered by the latest Kimi K3 multimodal visual agent AI model. Its core capability is **Vibe Coding** — generating websites from natural language and deploying them online.

## How do Kimi Websites work?

### Step 1: create a website via conversation

Describe your needs in natural language. Three creation methods are supported:

| Method | Description |
|--------|------------|
| **Text description** | Enter website requirements directly; AI generates automatically |
| **Design mockup parsing** | Upload a design file; AI recognizes and recreates as a web page |
| **Quick template build** | Select a preset template and modify content |

**Example prompt**:

<CodePreview
  files={[
    {
      name: "prompt.txt",
      language: "text",
      content: "Build a website for West Highland Terrier dogs with a black-and-white color scheme. Include three sections:\nA studio-quality photo calendar with AI-generated image display\nA \"Curly Lab\" care and grooming encyclopedia\nA merchandise store selling Westie-print hoodies and limited-edition silver-foil posters. The checkout page should include a charity module — donate $1 per item sold to stray dog rescue.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Step 2: building process

Kimi website activates the **webapp-building SKILL** — a dedicated multi-round code-generation agent:
1. **Requirement analysis**: Analyzes website modules, visual style, and interaction logic
2. **Task planning**: Decomposes into design, development, and asset preparation sub-tasks
3. **Tech stack selection**: Chooses appropriate architecture (e.g., React + Tailwind CSS)
4. **Asset generation**: Generates images, icons, and other visual assets
5. **Code construction**: Writes page structure, styling, and interaction code
6. **Multi-round optimization**: Self-adjusts based on preview results until complete

### Step 3: preview & adjust
- **Live preview**: Generates an HTML demo URL for immediate browser viewing
- **Conversational editing**: Continue the conversation to request changes, e.g., *"Make the navbar dark"*

<Callout type="tip">
**Example**: *"The colors aren't great — I'd like to drop the black-and-white requirement and make it a normal-looking website."*
Kimi will reorganize the to-do list and continue building.

### Step 4: visual online edit
- **Multi-round optimization**: Fine-tune details through ongoing conversation
- **Editing modes**:
  - **Annotation mode**: Click on areas to add natural-language annotations
  - **Selection mode**: Select any element and add annotations
  - Use rectangles, arrows, brushes, and color switching to mark up revision suggestions
- Send all revision suggestions to Kimi at once
### Step 5: deploy & publish
| Deployment Method | Description |
|-------------------|------------|
| **Auto-deploy** | One-click deployment with generated online link |
| **Download & self-host** | Download packaged code files and deploy to your own server |
| **Custom domain** | Bind the generated website to your own domain |

After generation, you can:
- Click different deployment versions to download version files
- Click the share button to get a publicly deployed link (or set to private)
- Click the edit button to continue revising
- Download the complete HTML/CSS/JS code for direct deployment or further refinement
